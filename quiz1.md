# Quiz 1

Please refrain from using any other resoures for this quiz. Let's really just check on what you have already learned.

To do this quiz, you'll want to [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repo to your own github.com account. From there...navigate to your `SavvyCoders` directory and `clone` it there. Note that this is just a simple MD repo, so you would not need to run `npm install` in this case.

Kindly add another 2nd level heading called 'Answers' and then just do a numbered list matching your 'answer number' with the '❓ number.'

Upon completion, `add` and `commit` and...get your changes up to github.com - hopefully you recall how to do that too.
